# SpriteKit
A Framework For using the Sprite Editor's Sprites in S&amp;Box

If you want to Integrate this into your Addons you need to take the Code/SpriteKit folder and put it into your Addon's Code/ folder.
for the shaders to work you need to drag the Shaders/VFX Folder and drop it into your Shaders/ folder as that contains the compiled versions of the .vfx files
